      <h2>My Assessment</h2><!--Hey Thomas!-->
      <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
      <div class="alert">
        <p>This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
      </div>
      <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
      <h3>Questions</h3>
      <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
      <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
      <p>The alt attribute makes it so that if an image were to not load there would be text in its place. The title attribute, when applied to text, makes the "title" that was inputted appear when the cursor is hovered over it.</p>
      <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
      <p><br>Vertiginous (adjective)</p>
      <ul>
